# brightness
Shell script to adjust screen brightness from the command line or with shortcut keys.

# Install

Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where you'd like to install `brightness`. I recommend `~/.local/bin`. (If you want to use `brightness` as a standard command, this must be a folder in your PATH.)

> cd ~/.local/bin
> git clone https://github.com/cfc23/brightness.git
> chmod +x brightness/brightness
